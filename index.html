            <p>We are so excited to welcome you to our wedding festivities on beautiful Lake Como at the Mandello del Lario on September 5th, 2020. You have all been indispensable parts of our journeys – you helped us grow through childhood, made us into men and women during high school, college and beyond, and have watched our lives transform over the past few years. We are blessed to be celebrating our wedding with such important people.
            
            <br></br>
            
            We can’t wait to celebrate with you all, and with our families! If you have any questions, please reach out to us at [should we get an email address for this?].

                        <p>It was Spring of their first year of Wharton and, like most days at school, Linda prepared to perform her talents (in this case, dance) in front of the school and Nathan hung out with friends before watching his more talented classmates perform. When Linda’s hip hop dance came on the stage, Nathan forgot the rest of the world existed. After the performance, fate gave him an assist; Linda waved to the friend he was talking to. “Who is THAT?” was the only thing worth saying at that point. He’d have to wait for his chance.</p>
                        
                        <p> Fast forward a couple months later, startup Lip and Linda were interning in San Francisco and were invited to the same trivia night. This was the moment. Nathan was there first, having a beer at the bar with his roommates. When Linda walked in, his heart skipped a beat. Here we go! She gave every other person at the bar a familiar, friendly hug before reaching her cold hand out to introduce herself to Nathan. Disturbed and offended that she had no recognition of him, Nathan proceeded to pout for the rest of the night. Linda wondered to herself, “who is this cute but extremely grumpy man?”
 </p>
 
 <p> The next time they saw each other out again, Nathan got his “good to see you!” hug from Linda and we. were. back. On her way out that night, time stopped. She came over to say goodbye and touched (stroked?) his arm. His group conversation completely shifted – what just happened? To this day, the “arm touch” is a debate about whether it was intentional or subconscious. But it was amazing and he replayed it for days.
 </p>
 <p> Pushing nerves aside, Nathan romantically “GroupMe-ed” Linda the next day and, knowing she had recently been to an art show in Berkeley, asked her if she wanted to go to an exhibit at the SF MoMA. Success! They spent an amazing afternoon together dissecting each of Edward Munch’s disturbing paintings, Linda astutely interpreting the artistic undertones of the work and Nathan making such random contextual observations that they were either brilliance or non-sense (we’ll let you decide). They spent hours in the courtyard braving the afternoon sun, each nervous about the sun exposure but thinking the other person was enjoying it, talking about family and upbringing, and immediately connected. It could have gone on for days. He had never been around someone with whom he had a stronger immediate connection, and was astounded by how perceptive, thoughtful, and brilliant this woman was.
 </p>
 <p>When they returned to school, it was game over. A couple weeks in, they went on a group trip to Munich for Oktoberfest (because of course they did). They spent the weekend together and, on the flight back, knew this was for keeps.
  </p>
  <p>Like most normal couples, Linda and Nathan went on a romantic trip to the south of France five weeks into “officially” dating. The trip cemented the view that they had a special bond brewing – wine, charcuterie, and France will do that to you. A few days after getting back post-Thanksgiving, Nathan told Linda that he wanted to marry her, and there has never been a second thought.

                    Despite living in California for years, neither Linda nor Nathan had ever driven from San Francisco to Los Angeles on the coastal highway. They decided it would be great to take a Friday off, drive halfway, rest the night, and then make it to LA the next day. Nathan found a cute and affordable (and cancellable!) AirBnB south of Big Sur and it was set! Nathan began agonizing over the details – where to do it, when, how to match up with the photographer. He decided that much of Big Sur was beautiful, but little of it is private without hiking. He wanted the day to be special and booked a room at Post Ranch Inn, a beautiful hotel on a private and tranquil property overlooking the coastline.

                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    Nathan became consumed with the details – timing up the transitions on the playlist for the ride, packing backup clothes for Linda, and worrying about traffic because of the U.S. Open. They started in classic Linda and Nathan fashion; she wanted to buy her family mochi treats from Japantown and he was focused on the gas meter showing empty and checking the traffic. Everything on the way was perfect – the sites, food on the way, driving hand in hand for hours, and yes, the traffic and music.

                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    After lunch, Nathan had a decision to make with too much time to spare before the agreed upon time with the photographer: show up early or try to stall. They continued on the road, past the hotel, and saw McWay Falls. Afterwards, he knew that the jig was up when he turned back towards the hotel instead of continuing on the road south. So did she; tears started showing up in her eyes as she took deep breaths to control her emotions.

                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    They checked into the hotel and received welcome Chardonnay. In Linda’s mind, they had the full afternoon to explore the property and sip their drinks. In Nathan’s mind, they were suddenly on the clock. They walked (briskly) to the predetermined spot and, full of anticipation, he gestured to her drink and signaled that she was taking too long to drink it. Instincts took over from there. Nathan essentially run blocked Linda down the hill to the spot (in his mind, this took 15 minutes; in reality, this took 15 seconds). Sense of urgency!
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    He began shaking and telling her how much she meant to him. How since they’ve been together, he’s never been happier and he’s known about their love for each other since the beginning. How he can’t wait to build a family together and care for each other’s families. How they’d be able to support each other through any adversity. He got on one knee and, with the roar of the Pacific crashing against the coastal cliffs and warmth of the sun in the blue Californian sky, asked her to be his life partner.

                    After graduating from Wharton, Linda and Nathan embarked on an important trip. They were visiting Israel, which is Nathan’s spiritual home and an important place for him, and Nantong, China, Linda’s hometown where most of her family still resides. It was decided, they would go to Israel and China, with Lake Como as a stop in between. They were touring the most meaningful sites in the world to each of them individually and sharing memories that made the places significant to them as a couple. In-between, they spent nearly a week in the Milan area and four days in Varenna, a town on Lake Como. High off the emotions of their trip, they digested that they had just visited Israel, were about to meet Linda’s extended family in her hometown, and would move into an apartment in SF together upon their return. The trip was, like many of their others, phenomenal. Lake Como was incredible -- views, food, wine, Italy – and we couldn’t be happier. But, something was different on this trip. They weren’t in school anymore, and this wasn’t a fluke in a honeymoon period. That understanding was memorialized on Lake Como.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    Since that trip, Lake Como remained a topic of conversation. They would joke from time to time about getting married there, and having a rehearsal dinner at their favorite restaurant in town. They hung a print of a photograph they took of Bellagio, another Lake Como town, above their living room couch at home. It remained the meat in the Israel-Nantong sandwich.

                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    Lake Como is not easy to get to for essentially all of our guests and we are eternally grateful if you are able to make it to celebrate with us. We are incredibly excited to celebrate our marriage in Lake Como, and we are thrilled you’ll be there to celebrate in a place that means so much to us.

                    There are three main airports in Milan: Malpensa (MXP), Linate (LIN), and Bergamo (BGY). Most, if not all, of the international flights will go through Malpensa, so the guide below is tailored to that landing spot. If you land in Bergamo or Linate, the adjustments listed will be to your train schedule.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    There are three main options for getting from MXP to Varenna, our home base for the weekend:
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    1. Take the train! It does require a connection and it will take a couple hours, but it is an absolutely beautiful ride - the route is indicated in the picture on the blue line. Here are the instructions:
                        <p style="margin-left: 40px"> a. Head to the airport rail station and buy tickets from MXP to Milano Centrale on the Malpensa Express and also Milano Centrale to Varenna-Esino. You can also buy these tickets online (http://store.trenord.it/trenord-rail-tickets and http://www.italiarail.com). </p>
                    
                        <p style="margin-left: 40px">
                            b. Head onto the Malpensa Express! It will only take a half hour from the airport to the first and last stop, Milano Centrale. Make sure you get on the Centrale train! </p>
                    
                            <p style="margin-left: 80px">i. You do need to validate tickets, so make sure you do so at the machines </p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
                    c. Find the train to Varenna, which you can also purchase online at ItaliaRail. This trip will take about an hour and will have stops. We’d recommend that you find a seat on the left side facing forward so you can maximize your views! </p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 80px"> i. Validate! </p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
                    d. If you’re landing at Linate, it’ll be easier to get to Centrale (there’s a bus). If you’re landing at Bergamo, there’s a bus to the train station in Bergamo, where you can hop on the train to Varenna, which is a bit shorter of a ride. </p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
                    e. All in all, this should take an hour and a half plus some buffer and cost ~$25 per person (less from LIN or BGY).
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    2. Get a car! From all three airports, it’s a scenic 60-90 minute drive (from MXP, it follows the red line). This will somewhat depend on the parking situation at your accommodation, but will make exploring the area incrementally easier. All in all, this is our least recommended option because of parking and cost of a rental car for 3-4 days.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    3. Call an Uber or private car! This will run you EUR125-175, depending on which company you use. That’s expensive, but it’s basically the same as a train if you can buddy up and easily the quickest option. Assuming someone else is on your flight or arriving at a similar time, this is the most recommended option. Closer to the date, we’ll ask for flight information so we can help people find reasonable transportation.
                    </p>
                    
                    </p>
