          <p>After graduating from Wharton, Linda and Nathan embarked on an important trip. They were visiting Israel, which is Nathan’s spiritual home and an important place for him, and Nantong, China, Linda’s hometown where most of her family still resides. It was decided, they would go to Israel and China, with Lake Como as a stop in between. They were touring the most meaningful sites in the world to each of them individually and sharing memories that made the places significant to them as a couple. In-between, they spent nearly a week in the Milan area and four days in Varenna, a town on Lake Como. High off the emotions of their trip, they digested that they had just visited Israel, were about to meet Linda’s extended family in her hometown, and would move into an apartment in SF together upon their return. The trip was, like many of their others, phenomenal. Lake Como was incredible -- views, food, wine, Italy – and we couldn’t be happier. But, something was different on this trip. They weren’t in school anymore, and this wasn’t a fluke in a honeymoon period. That understanding was memorialized on Lake Como.
          </p>
          <p>Since that trip, Lake Como remained a topic of conversation. They would joke from time to time about getting married there, and having a rehearsal dinner at their favorite restaurant in town. They hung a print of a photograph they took of Bellagio, another Lake Como town, above their living room couch at home. It remained the meat in the Israel-Nantong sandwich.
          </p>
          <p>Lake Como is not easy to get to for essentially all of our guests and we are eternally grateful if you are able to make it to celebrate with us. We are incredibly excited to celebrate our marriage in Lake Como, and we are thrilled you’ll be there to celebrate in a place that means so much to us.
