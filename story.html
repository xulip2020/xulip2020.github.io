          <p>It was Spring of their first year of Wharton and, like most days at school, Linda prepared to perform her talents (in this case, dance) in front of the school and Nathan hung out with friends before watching his more talented classmates perform. When Linda’s hip hop dance came on the stage, Nathan forgot the rest of the world existed. After the performance, fate gave him an assist; Linda waved to the friend he was talking to. “Who is THAT?” was the only thing worth saying at that point. He’d have to wait for his chance.
          </p>
          <p> Fast forward a couple months later, startup Lip and Linda were interning in San Francisco and were invited to the same trivia night. This was the moment. Nathan was there first, having a beer at the bar with his roommates. When Linda walked in, his heart skipped a beat. Here we go! She gave every other person at the bar a familiar, friendly hug before reaching her cold hand out to introduce herself to Nathan. Disturbed and offended that she had no recognition of him, Nathan proceeded to pout for the rest of the night. Linda wondered to herself, “who is this cute but extremely grumpy man?”
          </p>
          <p> The next time they saw each other out again, Nathan got his “good to see you!” hug from Linda and we. were. back. On her way out that night, time stopped. She came over to say goodbye and touched (stroked?) his arm. His group conversation completely shifted – what just happened? To this day, the “arm touch” is a debate about whether it was intentional or subconscious. But it was amazing and he replayed it for days.
          </p>
          <p> Pushing nerves aside, Nathan romantically “GroupMe-ed” Linda the next day and, knowing she had recently been to an art show in Berkeley, asked her if she wanted to go to an exhibit at the SF MoMA. Success! They spent an amazing afternoon together dissecting each of Edward Munch’s disturbing paintings, Linda astutely interpreting the artistic undertones of the work and Nathan making such random contextual observations that they were either brilliance or non-sense (we’ll let you decide). They spent hours in the courtyard braving the afternoon sun, each nervous about the sun exposure but thinking the other person was enjoying it, talking about family and upbringing, and immediately connected. It could have gone on for days. He had never been around someone with whom he had a stronger immediate connection, and was astounded by how perceptive, thoughtful, and brilliant this woman was.
          </p>
          <p>When they returned to school, it was game over. A couple weeks in, they went on a group trip to Munich for Oktoberfest (because of course they did). They spent the weekend together and, on the flight back, knew this was for keeps.
          </p>
          <p>Like most normal couples, Linda and Nathan went on a romantic trip to the south of France five weeks into “officially” dating. The trip cemented the view that they had a special bond brewing – wine, charcuterie, and France will do that to you. A few days after getting back post-Thanksgiving, Nathan told Linda that he wanted to marry her, and there has never been a second thought.

          <p>Despite living in California for years, neither Linda nor Nathan had ever driven from San Francisco to Los Angeles on the coastal highway. They decided it would be great to take a Friday off, drive halfway, rest the night, and then make it to LA the next day. Nathan found a cute and affordable (and cancellable!) AirBnB south of Big Sur and it was set! Nathan began agonizing over the details – where to do it, when, how to match up with the photographer. He decided that much of Big Sur was beautiful, but little of it is private without hiking. He wanted the day to be special and booked a room at Post Ranch Inn, a beautiful hotel on a private and tranquil property overlooking the coastline.
          </p>
          <p>Nathan became consumed with the details – timing up the transitions on the playlist for the ride, packing backup clothes for Linda, and worrying about traffic because of the U.S. Open. They started in classic Linda and Nathan fashion; she wanted to buy her family mochi treats from Japantown and he was focused on the gas meter showing empty and checking the traffic. Everything on the way was perfect – the sites, food on the way, driving hand in hand for hours, and yes, the traffic and music.
          </p>          
          <p>After lunch, Nathan had a decision to make with too much time to spare before the agreed upon time with the photographer: show up early or try to stall. They continued on the road, past the hotel, and saw McWay Falls. Afterwards, he knew that the jig was up when he turned back towards the hotel instead of continuing on the road south. So did she; tears started showing up in her eyes as she took deep breaths to control her emotions.
          </p>      
          <p>They checked into the hotel and received welcome Chardonnay. In Linda’s mind, they had the full afternoon to explore the property and sip their drinks. In Nathan’s mind, they were suddenly on the clock. They walked (briskly) to the predetermined spot and, full of anticipation, he gestured to her drink and signaled that she was taking too long to drink it. Instincts took over from there. Nathan essentially run blocked Linda down the hill to the spot (in his mind, this took 15 minutes; in reality, this took 15 seconds). Sense of urgency!
          </p>
          <p>He began shaking and telling her how much she meant to him. How since they’ve been together, he’s never been happier and he’s known about their love for each other since the beginning. How he can’t wait to build a family together and care for each other’s families. How they’d be able to support each other through any adversity. He got on one knee and, with the roar of the Pacific crashing against the coastal cliffs and warmth of the sun in the blue Californian sky, asked her to be his life partner.
